# Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe AI Tournament! 
To create an AI, clone the repository and create a class which extends `tic_tac_toe.TicTacToeAI`.
The tournament will track many statistics for each AI, including:
- Initialization time
- Think time
- Wins, Ties, Losses, and Forfeitures

An AI automatically forfeits the game if it makes 10 invalid moves in a single turn.

# Official Tournament

The official tournament will run for the month of March 2025. Submissions will be due by midnight on March 31st. 
Once all submissions have been received, the bots will face off and the results will be posted here.
