# AI Games

This is a repository dedicated to running AI tournaments for basic games.
"Official" tournaments are intended for myself and friends, but the code is available to allow anyone to run their own tournaments.
As time goes on, I will continue adding more game tournaments.

For more details, see the readme file for the game of interest
